# Dynamic Memory Management

Create a web-based application that dynamically generates and removes DOM elements based on user interactions. Implement a feature that tracks heap memory usage and displays it on the screen. If heap memory usage exceeds a specified limit, alert the user and provide suggestions on how to optimize their actions to reduce memory consumption.

Here is an example:

## Instructions

1. You have been given the basic boilerplate
2. Just complete the JS
3. Whenever the genrate button is clicked, `10000 elements` should be shown on the screen
4. Whenever the remove button is clicked, all the elements must be removed.
5. Whenever JS heap sized is reached show an alert with the text `Memory usage has exceeded 50 MB. Please optimize your actions to reduce memory consumption.`
